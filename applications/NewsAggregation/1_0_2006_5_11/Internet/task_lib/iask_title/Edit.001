Fig 12: (a) and (b) are standard stereo pair. (c) is the view after rotating camera on (b)¡¯s position. (d) and (e) are rectified results on (a) and (c) purely based on image. (d) and (e) apparently form a stere pair. Note that, in practice, (d) and (e) may be both rotated during rectification in relation to (a) and (b) respectively, and thus one cannot simply compute the difference between (a) and (d), for example.
